# Let's initialize our LoopBack application

üé¶ You can view a video walkthrough of this step here: [Initializing a LoopBack application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hFKR5YKrec&list=PLxGLihicw5Woe3SV9MCFooTdrI9eOmj54&index=3)

üñ• To see the code for this step, here is [commit/diff](https://github.com/StrongLoop-Evangelists/band-app/commit/e488c9cda9966ce3f4dfd6a5a8e67cc813494db0).

---

We can initialize a LoopBack application in our terminal by typing `lb` or `lb app` and this will invoke the generator. The generator will go through a series of prompts to scaffold our LoopBack application. Let's get started.

### What's the name of your application?

```
‚ûú  workshop-band-app git:(master) lb
? What's the name of your application? (workshop-band-app)
```

The first step is to name our application. Let's call it: `band-app`.

### Enter name of the directory to contain the project:

```
? Enter name of the directory to contain the project: (band-app)
```

In this step, we are simply choosing the name of the directory that we are going to build out the application into. By default, it assumes we would like to create a new directory with the same name as the application that we have given in the previous step. So let's hit enter and let the generator do its work.

**Outputs:**

```
? Enter name of the directory to contain the project: band-app
   create band-app/
     info change the working directory to band-app
```

_Note: If we want to name our directory something else, we can do so in this step. If we had already created a directory with the same name as our application---we are working from that directory---LoopBack will detect this and we could simply hit enter._


### Which version of LoopBack would you like to use?

```
? Which version of LoopBack would you like to use? (Use arrow keys)
  2.x (long term support)
‚ùØ 3.x (current)
```

We will choose the current version of LoopBack, 3.x.

_Note: While LoopBack version 2 is still being supported, version 3 is the current version and in general you should use it for new applications._

### What kind of application do you have in mind?

```
? What kind of application do you have in mind? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ api-server (A LoopBack API server with local User auth)
  empty-server (An empty LoopBack API, without any configured models or datasources)
  hello-world (A project containing a controller, including a single vanilla Message and a single remote method)
  notes (A project containing a basic working example, including a memory database)
```

We are presented with four options as starting points:

- api-server (A LoopBack API server with local User auth)
- empty-server (An empty LoopBack API, without any configured models or datasources)
- hello-world (A project containing a controller, including a single vanilla Message and
 a single remote method)
- notes (A project containing a basic working example, including a memory database)

We will choose the default option as it is useful to have a built-in User model to extend from when building our model for our users.

_Note: As alluded to above, it is best practice to extend base models such as `User` rather than using them directly. If we have multiple objects extending from a base model and we modify a base model, there may be adverse effects on all the models extending it._

_Pro tip: in the command line, type `j` or `k` or &uarr; and &darr; to navigate up or down._

### Scaffolding application and running `npm install`

```
? What's the name of your application? band-app
? Enter name of the directory to contain the project: band-app
   create band-app/
     info change the working directory to band-app

? Which version of LoopBack would you like to use? 3.x (current)
? What kind of application do you have in mind? api-server (A LoopBack API server with local User auth)
Generating .yo-rc.json


I'm all done. Running npm install for you to install the required dependencies. If this fails, try running the command yourself.


   create .editorconfig
   create .eslintignore
   create .eslintrc
   create server/boot/root.js
   create server/middleware.development.json
   create server/middleware.json
   create server/server.js
   create README.md
   create server/boot/authentication.js
   create .gitignore
   create client/README.md
```

For an explanation of all the files and directories that the tool creates, see [Project layout reference](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Project-layout-reference.html) in the LoopBack documentation.

At this point, the tool has scaffolded our application.  Then it runs `npm install` to install all of the application's external dependences. This may take a moment, depending on internet connection. Do not be alarmed by the many modules that are installed: to reduce duplication of effort, Node.js has a large ecosystem of many small modules. The Node package manager, npm, handles these modules in a smart and efficient manner.

Once the tool finishes installation of external modules, we will see a listing of these modules in a tree structure.

### Handy next steps for our convenience

```
Next steps:

  Change directory to your app
    $ cd band-app

  Create a model in your app
    $ lb model

  Run the app
    $ node .
```

At this point, our application is initialized and the terminal outputs some helpful next steps to continue development. In our next post, we will [Create our first model](02-first-model.md)
